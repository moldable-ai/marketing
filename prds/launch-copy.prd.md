# Launch Copy PRD — Moldable

## Why this exists
We want launch copy for X/Twitter that feels human-to-human (not “launch hype”), shows we understand the frustration of “apps that *almost* fit,” and then gives concrete links to use cases + starter apps.

## Goals
- Write X/Twitter copy that sounds casual, honest, and specific.
- Make the first “panel”/tweet sticky (but not corny).
- Shift quickly to value-first: why it matters, how it changes daily friction.
- Close with concrete things people can click: use cases + starter apps.

## Non-goals
- Brand manifesto / long-form landing page copy.
- Technical deep dive into architecture.
- Claims we can’t back up (“replaces everything,” “perfect,” etc.).

## Target audience (initial)
People who live in tool sprawl and workarounds:
- “Power users” of Notion/Sheets/Airtable + a dozen SaaS tools
- Builders (devs + non-devs) who keep duct-taping workflows
- Anyone who’s ever said: “this app is fine… I just need one thing different”

## Messaging anchors (from site copy)
- “Describe what you want and Moldable creates it.”
- “Everything runs locally on your machine.”
- “Apps evolve through conversation. Need a new feature? Just ask.”
- “Local-first / privacy: you own everything, no telemetry, opt-in AI.”
- “Start with free starter apps, or build something new.”

## Tone & guardrails
- Write like a person texting another person (short sentences, mild imperfections ok).
- Show empathy first; explain second; invite action last.
- Avoid: “revolutionary,” “game-changer,” “viral,” “disrupt,” “future of…”
- Prefer: concrete examples, specific frustrations, plain language.

## Deliverables
### A) Single-post announcement (casual, specific)
Tired of doing the same dance: buy an app → it’s *almost* right → hacks + spreadsheets → “maybe next quarter” feature request → repeat.

So we built Moldable: you describe the tool you wish you had, it builds it, and it runs locally... with the full power of your filesystem.

Start with something concrete: meeting notes, notes, todo, time tracking, calendar, git.
https://moldable.sh

### B) Thread version (8 tweets)
1) If you’ve ever thought “this app is fine… I just need it to do *one* thing differently” — same.
2) Most tools force you into their workflow. Then you end up with workarounds, tabs, and copy/paste glue.
3) Moldable is for that moment: tell it what you actually need, and it builds the app around *your* workflow.
4) And it’s local-first. Your apps + data live on your machine.
5) You can keep iterating in plain English: “add this”, “change that”, “export like this”.
6) Examples you can steal:
   - Meeting recorder + live transcript + notes
   - Notes (Keep-style)
   - Todo (fast + keyboard)
   - Time tracker (projects + export)
7) More:
   - Calendar view (Google sync)
   - Visual Git client
   - Language journal (live translation)
   - Affirmations (calming daily thing)
8) Use cases + starter apps:
https://moldable.sh/use-cases
https://moldable.sh/apps

### C) Carousel script (8 panels)
Panel 1 (sticky, not try-hard):
“Ever pay for an app and still end up in a spreadsheet?”

Panel 2:
“Because it’s never quite your workflow. It’s theirs.”

Panel 3:
“Moldable lets you describe the tool you want — and it builds it.”

Panel 4:
“Then you keep iterating: ‘add this’, ‘change that’, ‘export like this’.”

Panel 5:
“Local-first: your apps + data stay on your machine.”

Panel 6:
“Start from real templates:
meeting notes, notes, todo, time tracking…”

Panel 7:
“…calendar, git, language journal, affirmations.”

Panel 8:
“Links:
moldable.sh/use-cases
moldable.sh/apps”

## Last slide / closing panel (drafts)
### Your draft
“Moldable isn't an experiment. It's 30 years of pent up frustration using broken software that wasn't right for you.

Now, you can change that. You're in the drivers seat.

So let's drive: https://moldable.sh”

### What’s “off” / risky about it
- “Isn’t an experiment” can read defensive (and makes people wonder why you had to say it).
- “30 years” is a big claim and can feel abstract unless it’s clearly *your* story (and your age supports it).
- “Broken software” is pretty harsh; it can sound bitter vs. empathetic.
- “Driver’s seat / let’s drive” is a bit cliché; not a dealbreaker, but it’s the first place it shows up.

### Edits that keep your intent but land more human
Option A (simple + confident):
“Not a demo. Not a toy.
It’s the software you’ve been wishing your apps would become.

Take the wheel: https://moldable.sh”

Option B (empathy, less heat):
“If you’ve been bending your workflow around tools that *almost* fit — yeah.

Make the tool fit you: https://moldable.sh”

Option C (matches the “one thing differently” theme):
“The painful part isn’t the lack of apps.
It’s the last 20% they never build.

Close that gap: https://moldable.sh”

Option D (privacy-forward closer):
“Build what you need.
Keep it on your machine.

https://moldable.sh”

## Hooks to test (pick 1)
These are alternatives for the first tweet/panel—same message, different vibe.
- “I love software. I hate adapting my life to it.”
- “Why do ‘simple’ workflows always end up as 6 tools and a spreadsheet?”
- “You know the feeling: the app is 80% right… and you live in the other 20%.”
- “I’m not trying to ‘be more productive’. I just want my tools to stop fighting me.”
- “Every time I buy a tool I end up building a workaround. So… we built the tool-builder.”

## Use-case examples (short list for copy)
- Meeting Notes (record + live transcript + notes)
- Notes (Keep-style)
- Todo (priorities + keyboard)
- Time Tracker (projects + CSV export)
- Calendar (Google sync + agenda)
- Git (visual staging + diffs)
- Language Journal (live translation + TTS)
- Daily Affirmations (favorites + calming UI)

## Open questions (for iteration)
- Which audience are we writing to first? (founders / ops / devs / “everyone in tabs”)
- Do we want to lead with “local-first privacy” or “workflow fit”?
- Any words to avoid because they sound too “AI launch”? (list here)

## Next iteration checklist
- [ ] Choose 1 primary audience and rewrite the hook in their language
- [ ] Decide CTA: download vs. browse use cases vs. install starter apps
- [ ] Tighten the single post to fit character limits with one link
- [ ] Pick 2–3 example apps max (avoid laundry list in main post)
