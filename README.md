# Moldable: Personal software. Built for change.

**Your personal operating system for software that doesn't exist yet.**

Moldable is for people who refuse to settle for rigid, one-size-fits-all software. Instead of buying apps or waiting for someone to build what you need, you describe it — and Moldable creates it.

## The Vision

Software today is built for the masses, not the individual. It's often rigid, expensive, and disconnected from your actual workflow. Moldable inverts this model:

- **Software is summoned**: Describe your need in natural language, and a personal AI agent builds it instantly.
- **Software is shaped**: Evolve your apps through conversation. If your workflow changes, your software changes with it.
- **Software is discarded**: When a tool has served its purpose, discard it. Creating is so effortless that nothing needs to be permanent.

## Core Principles

### 1. Your Apps, Your Data
Everything runs locally on your machine. Connect to AI services when you choose, but your code and data live on your computer, not someone else's servers.

### 2. Built for Change
Moldable apps aren't static. They are "malleable" — ready to be reshaped at any moment as your needs and ideas evolve.

### 3. Isolated Workspaces
Organize your life into workspaces — Personal, Work, Side Projects — each with its own apps, data, and configuration. Switch between contexts instantly.

## Start with the Essentials

Moldable comes with a registry of "Essential Apps" that you can install for free and then mold to your liking:

- **🎙️ Meetings**: Record, transcribe, and summarize with real-time AI.
- **📓 Scribo**: A language learning journal with instant translations.
- **🗓️ Calendar**: A unified view of your time with deep integrations.
- **📝 Notes**: A flexible, markdown-first capture system.
- **✅ Todo**: Simple, fast task management.
- **🛠️ Git**: A developer-friendly version control client.
