# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2026-01-19

This Privacy Policy explains how **Desiderata LLC** ("Desiderata," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use Moldable (the "Service").

Moldable is designed as a **local-first application**—most of your data stays on your machine. This policy describes what limited information we may collect and how we handle it.

## TL;DR (friendly summary)

This section is a convenience summary. The full Privacy Policy below controls.

- Moldable is local-first: your apps, data, and configurations are stored on your machine, not our servers.
- Our website (moldable.sh) uses **Plausible Analytics** (cookie-less, privacy-respecting) to understand basic website usage.
- We don't have access to your locally stored apps, code, or personal data.
- When you connect third-party services (AI providers, MCPs, etc.), those interactions are governed by each service's privacy policy.
- **Google API data** (like Google Calendar) is stored locally on your device, not on our servers. Our use of Google data complies with [Google's Limited Use requirements](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#limited-use).
- You can contact **hello@moldable.sh** to exercise privacy rights or ask questions.

## 1. Who We Are (Data Controller)

Desiderata LLC is the entity responsible for processing personal information described in this Privacy Policy (the "data controller" in some jurisdictions).

## 2. Local-First Architecture

Moldable is designed to keep your data on your machine:

- **Apps and code** you create are stored locally in `~/.moldable/`
- **App data** (databases, files, etc.) is stored locally
- **Configurations and preferences** are stored locally
- **Conversation history** with the AI assistant is stored locally

**We do not have access to this locally stored data.** It never leaves your machine unless you explicitly choose to share it (for example, by pushing to GitHub).

## 3. Information We Collect

### 3.1 Information you provide

- **Contact information**: If you contact us for support, we may collect your email address and the content of your communications.
- **Feedback**: Suggestions or feedback you voluntarily submit.

### 3.2 Information we may collect automatically

- **Website analytics**: Our website (moldable.sh) uses **Plausible Analytics** to measure aggregate website usage (for example, page views and referrers). Plausible is designed to be cookie-less and to avoid collecting personal data. Learn more: [https://plausible.io/data-policy](https://plausible.io/data-policy).
- **Download metrics**: When you download the application from GitHub or other distribution platforms, those platforms may collect basic metrics (such as download counts).

### 3.3 Information we do NOT collect

- The content of apps you create
- Your code or generated code
- Your local files or databases
- Your conversation history with the AI assistant
- API keys or credentials you configure locally

### 3.4 Third-party AI services

When you use AI features in Moldable, your prompts and queries are sent to third-party AI providers. These interactions are governed by the third-party provider's privacy policy. We recommend reviewing their policies:

- Anthropic: [https://www.anthropic.com/privacy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy)
- OpenAI: [https://openai.com/privacy](https://openai.com/privacy)
- OpenRouter: [https://openrouter.ai/privacy](https://openrouter.ai/privacy)

**Be mindful of what you share with AI providers.** Avoid including sensitive information (passwords, API keys, personal data) in prompts unless you understand how the provider handles that data.

## 4. How We Use Information

We use the limited information we collect to:

- Provide and improve the Service
- Respond to support requests
- Send important updates about the Service (if you've provided contact information)

## 5. How We Share Information

We may share information:

- **With service providers** that help us operate the Service (for example, hosting, support tools)
- **For legal reasons** if required to comply with law, or to protect rights, safety, and security
- **In connection with a business transfer** such as a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets

We do not sell your personal information.

## 6. Third-Party Services

Moldable may integrate with third-party services. When you use these integrations, your data is subject to the third party's privacy policy:

- **AI providers**: Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, or other AI services you configure
- **MCPs**: Model Context Protocol servers you connect
- **Other services**: Any third-party services you choose to integrate (e.g., calendar APIs, databases)

We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party services you use.

## 7. Google API Services

When you connect Google services (such as Google Calendar) to Moldable, we access your Google data only as described below. Our use of information received from Google APIs adheres to the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy), including the Limited Use requirements.

### 7.1 Google Calendar

When you connect your Google Calendar:

- **Where it's stored**: Calendar data is cached locally on your device in `~/.moldable/`. We do not store your calendar data on our servers.
- **How long we keep it**: Cached data is refreshed each time you use the app. You can disconnect your Google account at any time to remove stored tokens and cached data.

### 7.2 Limited Use Disclosure

Moldable's use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes), including the Limited Use requirements:

- Humans do not read your Google data unless you provide explicit consent, it's required for security/abuse investigation, or required by law.

## 8. Cookies and Tracking

The Moldable desktop application does not use cookies or tracking.

Our website (moldable.sh) uses **Plausible Analytics**, which is designed to operate **without cookies** and without tracking you across sites. If we materially change our website analytics practices, we will update this policy.

## 9. Data Retention

- **Local data**: Data stored on your machine is retained until you delete it.

Your local data is protected by your device's security measures. We recommend:

- Being cautious about which apps and skills you install
