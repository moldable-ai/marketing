# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2026-01-15

This Privacy Policy explains how **Desiderata LLC** ("Desiderata," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use Moldable (the "Service").

Moldable is designed as a **local-first application**—most of your data stays on your machine. This policy describes what limited information we may collect and how we handle it.

## TL;DR (friendly summary)

This section is a convenience summary. The full Privacy Policy below controls.

- Moldable is local-first: your apps, data, and configurations are stored on your machine, not our servers.
- We don't currently collect analytics or telemetry. If we add this in the future, it will be opt-in anonymous telemetry.
- We don't have access to your locally stored apps, code, or personal data.
- When you connect third-party services (AI providers, MCPs, etc.), those interactions are governed by each service's privacy policy.
- You can contact **hello@moldable.sh** to exercise privacy rights or ask questions.

## 1. Who We Are (Data Controller)

Desiderata LLC is the entity responsible for processing personal information described in this Privacy Policy (the "data controller" in some jurisdictions).

## 2. Local-First Architecture

Moldable is designed to keep your data on your machine:

- **Apps and code** you create are stored locally in `~/.moldable/`
- **App data** (databases, files, etc.) is stored locally
- **Configurations and preferences** are stored locally
- **Conversation history** with the AI assistant is stored locally

**We do not have access to this locally stored data.** It never leaves your machine unless you explicitly choose to share it (for example, by pushing to GitHub).

## 3. Information We Collect

### 3.1 Information you provide

- **Contact information**: If you contact us for support, we may collect your email address and the content of your communications.
- **Feedback**: Suggestions or feedback you voluntarily submit.

### 3.2 Information we may collect automatically

- **No analytics currently**: We do not currently collect usage analytics or telemetry. If we add anonymous telemetry in the future, it will be clearly disclosed and opt-in.
- **Download metrics**: When you download the application from GitHub or other distribution platforms, those platforms may collect basic metrics (such as download counts).

### 3.3 Information we do NOT collect

- The content of apps you create
- Your code or generated code
- Your local files or databases
- Your conversation history with the AI assistant
- API keys or credentials you configure locally

### 3.4 Third-party AI services

When you use AI features in Moldable, your prompts and queries are sent to third-party AI providers. These interactions are governed by the third-party provider's privacy policy. We recommend reviewing their policies:

- Anthropic: [https://www.anthropic.com/privacy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy)
- OpenAI: [https://openai.com/privacy](https://openai.com/privacy)
- OpenRouter: [https://openrouter.ai/privacy](https://openrouter.ai/privacy)

**Be mindful of what you share with AI providers.** Avoid including sensitive information (passwords, API keys, personal data) in prompts unless you understand how the provider handles that data.

## 4. How We Use Information

We use the limited information we collect to:

- Provide and improve the Service
- Respond to support requests
- Send important updates about the Service (if you've provided contact information)

## 5. How We Share Information

We may share information:

- **With service providers** that help us operate the Service (for example, hosting, support tools)
- **For legal reasons** if required to comply with law, or to protect rights, safety, and security
- **In connection with a business transfer** such as a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets

We do not sell your personal information.

## 6. Third-Party Services

Moldable may integrate with third-party services. When you use these integrations, your data is subject to the third party's privacy policy:

- **AI providers**: Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, or other AI services you configure
- **MCPs**: Model Context Protocol servers you connect
- **Other services**: Any third-party services you choose to integrate (e.g., calendar APIs, databases)

We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party services you use.

## 7. Cookies and Tracking

The Moldable desktop application does not use cookies or tracking. Our website (moldable.sh) does not currently use cookies or analytics.

If we add analytics to the website in the future, we will update this policy and use privacy-respecting, anonymous methods.

## 8. Data Retention

- **Local data**: Data stored on your machine is retained until you delete it.
- **Support communications**: We retain support communications for as long as reasonably necessary to provide support and maintain records.

## 9. Security

We implement reasonable security measures to protect information we collect. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

Your local data is protected by your device's security measures. We recommend:

- Keeping your operating system and software updated
- Using strong device passwords/encryption
- Being cautious about which apps and skills you install

## 10. Your Rights and Choices

### 10.1 Local data

You have full control over your local data. You can:

- View, modify, or delete any data in `~/.moldable/`
- Export your data at any time
- Uninstall the application and delete all local data

### 10.2 Future telemetry

If we add anonymous telemetry in the future, it will be opt-in and you will be able to control it in Moldable settings.

### 10.3 Privacy rights

Depending on where you live, you may have rights to:

- Access information we hold about you
- Request correction of inaccurate information
- Request deletion of your information
- Object to certain processing

To exercise these rights, contact us at **hello@moldable.sh**.

### 10.5 California residents

If you are a California resident, you may have rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), including the right to know what personal information we collect and request deletion. We do not sell personal information.
