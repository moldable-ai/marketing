## TL;DR (friendly summary)

This section is a convenience summary. The full Terms below control.

## Privacy

Our collection and use of personal information is described in our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy). Moldable is primarily a local-first application—e.g. data stays on your machine. Our website analytics practices (if any) are also described in the Privacy Policy.

## 1. Definitions

For purposes of these Terms:

- **"Moldable"** or **"Desktop App"** means the Moldable desktop application software.
- **"Apps"** means the applications created by or for use within Moldable, including official apps from the moldable-ai/apps repository and any apps you create.
- **"Skills"** means CLI-invocable tools and capabilities that extend Moldable's functionality.
- **"User Content"** means any content you create, upload, or generate through the Service, including apps, skills, configurations, and data.
- **"Official Apps"** means apps distributed through the moldable-ai/apps repository or moldable.sh.

## 2. Eligibility

You must be at least 18 years old and able to form a binding contract to use the Service. You may not use the Service if you are barred from receiving services under applicable law.

## 3. The Service

Moldable provides a desktop application for creating, running, and managing personal software locally on your machine. The Service includes:

- The Moldable desktop application
- Official apps distributed through our app registry
- Skills and capabilities that extend functionality
- Documentation and support resources

You understand and agree that:

- The Service is provided primarily for personal and individual use.
- Apps run locally on your machine; we do not host or run your apps on our servers.
- The quality, functionality, and safety of apps (including Official Apps) may vary.
- We may change, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Service at any time.
- The Service may be offered in alpha, beta, or other early-stage form. Features may change, and the Service may experience interruptions, errors, or data loss.

## 4. Official Apps and Third-Party Apps (Important)

### 4.1 Official Apps

Official Apps distributed through moldable-ai/apps are provided under the MIT License. These apps are:

- Provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind
- Not guaranteed to be free of bugs, errors, or security vulnerabilities
- Subject to change or discontinuation at any time

**USE OFFICIAL APPS AT YOUR OWN RISK.** We make no representations about the suitability, reliability, or accuracy of Official Apps for any purpose.

### 4.2 Third-Party and User-Created Apps

Apps created by you or third parties are not reviewed, endorsed, or guaranteed by Desiderata. You are solely responsible for:

- Evaluating the safety and suitability of any app before running it
- Any consequences of running third-party or user-created apps on your machine
- Ensuring apps you create or distribute do not violate laws or third-party rights

### 4.3 AI-Generated Code

Moldable may assist in generating code using AI. You understand that:

- AI-generated code may contain errors, security vulnerabilities, or unintended behavior
- You are responsible for reviewing and testing any AI-generated code before use
- AI-generated code may inadvertently include patterns similar to existing code; you are responsible for ensuring compliance with third-party licenses and rights

### 4.4 AI Security Considerations

Large language models (LLMs) and AI-powered applications are an evolving technology with known and unknown security risks. You understand and accept that AI systems may be vulnerable to various attacks and failure modes, including but not limited to:

- **Prompt injection**: Malicious content in files, websites, or data sources could manipulate the AI's behavior in unintended ways
- **Data exfiltration**: A compromised or malicious MCP server, skill, or app could potentially access data the AI has visibility into
- **Hallucinations**: AI may generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information, including fake URLs, non-existent APIs, or incorrect code
- **Sensitive data exposure**: Information you share in prompts is sent to third-party AI providers
- **Other vulnerabilities**: New attack vectors and security issues may be discovered as the technology evolves

You are responsible for exercising caution when:

- Installing third-party apps, skills, or MCP servers
- Allowing the AI to access sensitive files or data
- Acting on AI-generated information without verification
- Sharing sensitive information in prompts

**We are not liable for any damages resulting from AI-related security issues, whether known or unknown, including those not listed above.** You use AI features at your own risk.
